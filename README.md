# Finetuning Language Models

This repository provides tools and scripts for fine-tuning language models on various tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text translation. It includes preprocessing utilities, training pipelines, and inference modules to streamline the fine-tuning process.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for preparing datasets, including tokenization and formatting for models like Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Training**: Scripts for training language models with custom configurations.
- **Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating model performance on test datasets.
- **Prediction**: Modules for running inference on new data.

## Getting Started
