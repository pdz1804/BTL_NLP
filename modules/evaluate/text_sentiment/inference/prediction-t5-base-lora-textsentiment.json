provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now i have seen all three pokmon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing pokmon in theaters i cant help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb extreme sarcasm there and created this crappossible spoilers from here onwell i guess i should first talk about pikachus rescue adventure my first gripe with this came with no narration i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokdex narration that plagued pikachus vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle womans voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration all together this wouldnt have been a problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didnt let togepi go until the end possibly the fans but im sure not the parents then theres the theme song i couldnt help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana nice music fun to watch thats changed with the bellossom the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the pokmon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary oh and then theres the poliwhirl who thinks hes a poliwrath youd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but i havent touched on the worst of it yetyoud think that the warning signs wouldve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power for some unfathomable reason i had been placing some faith in kids and the wb my thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well that in mind i just didnt pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said you will believe that one person can make all the difference with the way they said that at every turn i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version then comes nintendo power in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature the power of one at that point i became a bit more uneasy the power of one not a good sign however i still kept some of my false faith big mistakesitting in the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle i can see a point in that since they didnt pander this thing repeating it over and over like in msb however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash ah hah so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony this time hes the chosen one a greater way that this did damage was to lugia lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokmon movie when the movie was about lugia in this one lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash in the scene where theyre flying back to the main island lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugias existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasnt really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the waya lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking fururas flute song wasnt nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card ugh even worse mistys outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held why didnt you put them in pokballs when you caught them this is like caging them to be displayed much different from whining about him thinking pokmon are things to be collected like stamps if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american pokmon movie im going to see ive imported the third one and find it very enjoyable i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two ill be importing the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and kids you have forsaken me for the last time",

of tragic melancholic roles this opinion however does not resemble neorealist movies in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the postman always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which id like to entail belowfirst viscontis movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna clara calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr giuseppe bragana juan de landa her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters we have to love each other affectionately answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything isnt it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that its not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provokingsecond ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at ginogiovannas first meeting the first focus of camera is on giovannas legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious lookthird ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona clara calamai who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performancein sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely fellinis style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you dont have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of viscontis best",

the silence of the lambs seen serial killer thrillers i have seen in fact it makes friday the th look sophisticated realistic the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin for a start it takes itself deadly seriously that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad the characters are truly awful i didnt believe any of them were actual human beings first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down theres just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally cant do anything but lie in bed for the whole film he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance im not being funny here but wouldnt any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance why is he so impressed with her then theres capatin cheney who is not only unlikable shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh skin surgically removed from their bodies how exactly did

spent six years in jail for something they actually did if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target rhyme anything else also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife being able to walk use their arms they are actually defeated nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck how did that happen i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photos shoots rats for no apparent reasonbesides some of the worst written characters ever the story plot isnt much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims its never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims also the killers clues are a little obscure arent they i mean a bloody animal bone shaved rat hair logically how does someone go from a bone rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim has the whole of new york to choose from theres some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going there is so much wrong with the bone collector it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever its atrocious on all levels has zero credibility apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distractingwith a supposed budget of about the bone collector is well made with good production values that hollywood gloss about it i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen i think she is absolutely terrible in this denzel washington just sort of lies there really queen latifah is awful even michael rooker cant do much as he is stuck with a clichd one dimensional characterthe bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while i saw it for free on telly last night i still feel cheated rippedoff there are just so many things to poke holes at its silly embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing works either way to be honest",

any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it and even these we are hardly ever shown it poses very interesting questions about life especially in the way that the movies tagline says that only one of them is really alive and by the way even though the tagline refers only to dave ed harris and megs robert deniro it is talking about all three of the characters in the film dave and megs were friends in the vietnam war and megs has returned to take dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed deniro provides a perfect performance of the character of megs who we are not really sure if we should like or if he really is as nuts as martha thinks he is dave reminds martha several times that megs is not his friend just someone he knows there is a great scene early in the film where megs has gone out to grab a six pack of beer from his car for breakfast and he is just around the corner of the room when dave says this megs pauses for a moment and then proceeds into the room with a smile and a huge greeting it isnt until later that you realize how megs must have felt when he heard that having been the one to remember what they had planned to do on this day it reminds me of the fakeness of the old sure lets do that thing that people so often say to each other never having any plans to do any such thinged harris delivers a wonderful performance as dave who never got over the effects that the war had on him even so many years later he has not managed to get over the death of a friend during the war blaming himself to this day for it and thus drowning his life in alcohol cigarettes and loneliness all he wants he says is for people to leave him alone this is not a man who is living his life the way he wants whether people actually leave him alone or not he is a man trying to forget that hes alive to detach himself from the world of the living as much as possiblehis sister martha reminds me of myself at least in terms of my roommates i have two roommates who are and years old and both act like they still live with their mothers expecting their messes to just go away when they leave the room for a while one on particular the older one sadly enough has absolutely no clue how to care for himself im surprised i dont have to wipe his chin while he eats martha has to do much the same for her brother who she waits on hand and foot while he staggers through life from one hangover to the next martha and dave are stuck in a stagnant life and neither of them can get out of it until something major changes and dave is the one that needs to do the changing i tend to complain about romance in movies where it just doesnt belong about as much as roger ebert complains about those pathetic little tension devices the red digital readout but in this case i dont think that the romance that develops between megs and martha had any adverse affect on the rest of the movie on the contrary it made it that much more interesting because it was not predictable the problem with the romantic subplots in bruckheimer movies and whatnot is that they are so predictable that you just wait for the obvious end to come and hope that something interesting happens along the way in this case however its not as obvious that something is going to happen between megs and martha because we dont know enough about megs martha could be right about him that hes one of daves crazy war buddies and that hes not the kind of man that she should be dating dave certainly encourages this ideaspoilers a couple years after this movie deniro did cape fear where he plays a deranged criminal out for revenge against the lawyer that landed him in prison a character that in retrospect makes it pretty easy to think that maybe at the end of jacknife martha realizes her mistake gets rid of megs and she and dave make up because he saved her from a horrible relationship and then he decides to clean up his act because he has done something good for her i was half expecting this to happen so i was pleasantly surprised when martha and megs wound up together and even more pleasantly surprised when megs asks dave all the questions about what they had planned to do after the war was over at times this is a slow moving drama but jacknife is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy there is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that scarcely fits with the rest of the movie but it is so good that it doesnt dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point everyone involved gives a wonderful performance and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your fists victoriously in the air",

finely tuned functioning of the brain this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory and how much do we really know of its innerworkings of its depth or capacity what is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream or can we perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see like looking at a painting by monet in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality its a concept visited by filmmaker cameron crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousnessaltering film vanilla sky starring tom cruise and penelope cruz at the age of thirtythree david aames cruise inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father his fiftyone percent controlling interest however has made him something of a marked man as there are seven members of his board of directors and each deems himself more worthy than the young mr aames of the lions share of the company and fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that david lacks the focus the job requiresadmittedly david likes to play still hes in control of the business and does what he sees fit whether the board he refers to them as the seven dwarfs likes it or not and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly but during a lavish birthday party in his honor one of the corporate lawyers thomas tipp timothy spall warns david that the seven are up to something behind his back at the time however its the last thing on davids mind hes been having a casual affair with a friend julie gianni cameron diaz but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he cant get out of his mind her name is sofia penelope cruz and after knowing her for only one night she becomes a pivotal part of his life which is about to be turned upside down as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever and he is about to learn that sometimes there is simply no going backdirector cameron crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one far more than a movie vanilla sky is a vision realized beginning with the first images that appear on screen he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting its a mindtwisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away emotionally its a rush and it may leave you exhausted because it requires some effort to stay with it but its worth it think memento with a driving rock n roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionists brush theres darkness and light and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky simply put this ones a real trip its exciting and its a mind benderas to the performances here those who cant get past the mindset of tom cruise as maverick in top gun or his ethan hunt in mission impossible or those who perceive him only as a movie star rather than an actor are going to have to think again in light of his work here because as david aames cruise gives the best performance of his career one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door hes made some interesting career choices the past few years with films like magnolia and eyes wide shut merely warmups for the very real and complex character he creates here and give him credit too for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity this is cruise as youve never seen him before jerry maguire earned him an oscar nomination and this one should also as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers cruise is not just good in this movie he is remarkablepenelope cruz turns in an outstanding if not exceptional performance as well as sofia the woman of davids dreams theres an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special something extra to the part but crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors and he certainly did with cruzhe also knew what he was doing with cameron diaz who is absolutely vibrant in the role of julie shes never looked better and fairly sizzles on screen but make no mistake this is no windowdressing part and diaz delivers a complete package with this character the quality of her performance can be measured in fact in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time and its the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes julie so unforgettable overall a terrific job by diazthe supporting cast includes kurt russell dr mccabe jason lee brian johnny galecki peter armand schultz dr pomerantz noah taylor ed mel thompson le man jean carol woman in new york and john fedevich silent ed about halfway through this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality but rest assured by the end of vanilla sky all will be revealed its a realitybender to be sure and a wild one but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying and unique experience one you have to see to believe its the essential and absolute magic of the movies",

being captured by one of ches murdersquads or having to sit through hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isnt why this petproject was made but what took them so long by them im referring of course to leftwing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltowns least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even its a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically onesided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and wellknown communist hasnt been a film topic of theirs yetguerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truthbending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood bigbudget political fairytale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi ie almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this mans actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the directors lack of sound judgmentthe movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the hour mark so its quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the films length indicates that a bulk of ches life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on ches last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevaras alleged idealism psychopaths dont have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of ches earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this overpraised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a hour moviesoderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term theyre supposedly siding withhalf of all students around the world wear ches image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this mans face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines ones overall shallowness and total disinterest in selfeducation wouldnt you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising hisher face to the world wearing ches bynow clich image has become as common as having a bart

from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like the longest day and the green berets which seem more like disney fantasies by comparison the apocalypse now project the production and resulting film is heart of darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late th century postmodernist variety the cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve this is the plight of joseph conrads original character kurtz who came into literary being in and subsequently referenced in ts eliots the hollow men mistah kurtz he dead of although neither a straight telling of conrads heart of darkness nor a firsthand account of the vietnam experience apocalypse now stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like platoon and the deer hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale apocalypse now is not so much seen as experiencedthe bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin captain benjamin willard martin sheen in a tourdeforce performance aboard a us military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of vietnam and cambodia where few westerners would ever tread his mission is to terminate colonel kurtz marlon brando a career army special forces division officer who was the darling of the us military until he went awol and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between vietnam laos and cambodia the official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity sheens mission is to terminate the colonel with the american public none the wiserthe movie is rather episodic the journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as sheen and his crew meet different selfcontained aspects of the war at the ground level american audiences of the s had probably never seen this kind of filmmaking before with the possible exception of the deer hunter which was released in the previous year the first and one of the most notable is an helicopter battalion led by col kilgore robert duvall in an oscarnominated performance who is a cross between general robert e lee and richard wagner he loves to play ride of the valkyries from wagners the ring when he bombards helpless villages his line i love the smell of napalm in the morning is one of those oftquoted lines from the annals of cinema other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of hugh heffner and playboy bunniesdespite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing the original release not the later redux version does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between willard and kurtz the strange discourse between willard and kurtz is worth the price of admission alone and some of the shots of both sheen and brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film not even the likes of clive barker wes craven or david cronenberg have anything on coppola in terms of horrific imagery brandos kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from withinwithout giving too much away coppolas solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations according to the documentary hearts of darkness coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movies darker hues would be compromised he wasnt sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom coppola was using as extras in the scenes with kurtz at his village after the viewing coppola had his ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of american filmmaking love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scenethis film is not for all tastes just as conrads original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes its not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most american viewers to absorb its the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average moviegoer to handle which is as it should be coppola did not make a family picture however if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of apocalypse now if youre looking for a film experience to reaffirm preexisting attitudes about american sensibility and heroism better stick with john wayne but if youre willing to be taken into places youve never been even beyond the evils of war rhetoric apocalypse now will take you into a world you thought youd never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize

backward and unfair for one the song played on es car radio when pulled up alongside a very rightwing israeli driver was i put a spell on you by natacha atlas the songs style is quite arabic but it was released on an israeli compilation cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel many israeli songs as well as architecture foods and slang are influenced by arabic culture and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song the way es appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare via a long still shot is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist and es as noble and temperatei have traveled all over israel and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster since service is mandatory but in the film not only is there a recruitment poster but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words want to shoot this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers and such an advertisement wouldnt even exist on a random israeli highway in including it the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of antiarab racists hellbent on murderthe ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent a hollywoodstyle action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israelidirected film as the ninja scene should have been but for some reason images of an unrealistic noncomic and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges portraying the other as human or working towards peace violence is made to be the only solution this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction one of my best friends serves in the israeli military and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black or any other quasicivilian on canvas soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger the method according to my friend is to provide a warning shout fire into the air or around the area and then if all else fails shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head as shown in the film is not the proper procedurebesides these inaccuracies the directing style was also poor repetition became repetitious and no longer captivating symbols such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem and it is created for no reason by es the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overlyovert claim of an israeli double standard by the director the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill showing the routines of random people over and over again even with a slight change each time and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes the dreariness of life without allowing much room for personal interpretation by contrasting one section of the movie daily life in nazareth with the second section the checkpoint between ramallah and israel the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly arguedi spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly and why many modern fashionshowlike and metalaction tracks were included in the score i still cannot come up with an answer i felt that the music was out of place in this film the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thoughtprovoking i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint albeit defiantly in fact i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes whatever the directors intent it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the filmthis film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to actually address any issues it is a propaganda film because the director intends various symbols styles and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception the vibrant atmosphere of an actionpacked hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side there is no thought reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept there in a good vs bad clich scenario i believe this film lacked the depth quality and power of other palestinian films such as paradise now and wedding in the galilee",

cinematography the lady from shanghai didnt quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film thats mostly people talking with each other in various situations thats quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a for methe lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael ohara ohara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him ohara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk ohara into working for them despite his initial reservationsit seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and ohara doesnt want to get involvedshortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says hes arthurs partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks ohara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly ohara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealedmaybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far im not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i havent seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but ive tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performancearty i love f for fake vrits et mensonges for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane never did much for me despite giving it or chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low the same as my current score for the lady from shanghaiwelles performance and the dialogue hes written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me hes a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotonehe tends to sound like hes reading his performance reminded me of what ive seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as but completed in it can also be seen in orson welles the oneman band where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that hes inherently sublimely dramatic im also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me tooas for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course shes gorgeous which doesnt hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to mei never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesnt seem to fit welles often shoots him in closeup and anders almost always has some overexaggerated manic expression on his sweaty facestructurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first minutes or so are extremely bland and soapoperatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crimemystery film its too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellencethe ending is more actionoriented lessdialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crimemystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a the final scenes are easily s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time its well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolismthe cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually cant make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the mazelike caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romancesurely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course its worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film in my view but its dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution",

        "input": "determine text sentiment: film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema the pioneers of such epics particularly biblical ones were dw griffith with his mother of all epics intolerance and cecil b demille with his flair for magnificent spectacles costumes and lavish scenes who can forget his ten commandments or the sign of the cross nevertheless here comes another epic made in the s directed by michael curtiz and based on the novel by mika waltari the egyptian michael curtiz already famous for his great classic casablanca wonderfully manages to adjust his film to the audiences of that time to entail the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the egyptians who lived in one of the most amazing periods in the reign of akhnatonthe first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character that edmund purdom plays sinuhe having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents becomes a physician all his life he never stops asking a question why and searching for the answer alluring love that he finds in a courtesan nefer bella darvi leads him to financial and spiritual disaster he has to repair the mistakes by hard work in the house of death and starting to build up his reputation from nothing first he thinks that the only cure is revenge however in the long run he realizes that eye for eye is no solution finally what stands before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh nevertheless there is one moment he finds the answer for his questions that touched him throughout his life the story of the main character though based on the book is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film the main characters psychological struggle is intensified by the times he lived in the times when probably for the first time to that extend the power of sword clashed with the power of thoughtcurtizs movie also retains one rule that all films of his era kept to great cast and lavish sets there are mostly british actors and actresses who give very nice performances how is it possible not to mention the mainstay of ancient epic victor mature this time he is not demetrius hannibal or samson but horemheb a fighter a lover at last a pharaoh jean simmons appears in a very delicate role of merit a woman who loved sinuhe all her life but it was too late when he realized that peter ustinov probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as nero in quo vadis three years earlier does a great job as kaptah sinuhes friend the royalty of the film is also played by two great cast gene tierney and michael wilding tierney is excellent as cold desirous of power baketamon the sister of pharaoh wilding gives a marvelous performance as insane akhnaton when i was in louvre in paris and saw akhnatons original face carved in stone he looked very much the same as the actor in the film bella darvi an actress born in poland is quite memorable as a wicked courtesan nefer and there is one more actress who appears only in one scene but whom it is hard to forget judith evelyn as taia pharaohs mother this voice these eyesthe sets are magnificent the director recreated the most probable image of the outdoor temple of aaton the god that the egyptians worshiped to in the reign of amenhotep iv i also loved the scene of pharaohs first entrance what a glorious picture that forever lasts in ones memory however there is also one aspect that i would like to draw the attention of all people interested to see the film the egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects but it also stands out as a unique film there are very few films which make such a wonderful use of different curiosities as for ancient times there is a mention of iron used first by the hetites its also the only film about ancient egypt which talks openly of egyptians magnificent curing abilities it memorably shows the contrasts of lifestyles particularly the moment of a slaves death for whom no one cares followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of pharaoh finally the egyptian shows one historical fact there were other nations except for jews before christ where the spirit of god shone in some human hearts yet the only difference was that it did not survive that long as at jews because it did not have a strong fundament the scene of akhnatons death supplies you with so many biblical and christian values that you may think you watch a religious movieall things considered i highly recommend michael curtiz film it is a great production at multiple levels an entertainment for epic fans an admiration of marvelous performances for cinema fans a soul feast for spiritual people finally it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things which happened thirteen centuries before the birth of jesus christ",

our heroine gets too many convenient breaks naturally the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldnt hit the side of a barn with a howitzer as the main antagonist dick merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like anything worth having is worth stealing additionally composer monk huggins does provide a strong atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the best song with barbara mason warbling it is good man is gone sheba baby casts grier as stylist chicago gumshoe sheba shayne she leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of louisville kentucky to help out her father when she arrives in louisville sheba learns that her father andy rudy challenger of detroit is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed pilot cigarchomping durville martin of hammer who demands that andy sell out his loan company to pilot or dieinitially pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash andys office but our heroines father catches them in the act they turn shebas father into a punching bag interestingly during the fight scene girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh earlier andys righthand man brick williams austin stoker of horror high had sent sheba a telegram requesting that she return to louisville but she didnt receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didnt know where to find her brick and sheba hook up rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the sack brick spends most of his time urging sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity as a former louisville kentucky police woman sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second after she arrives home sheba borrows her fathers car and barely escapes being blown to bits as she is walking out the door to get into her fathers car andy receives another harassing call from pilot previously andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to pilot but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum a gratified pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse in other words cranking up the car wont trigger the explosion the explosion comes ten seconds later andy and brick rescue sheba before the car blows up earlier sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference dad i know you think im doing a mans job but im not going to sit on the sidelines just because im a woman sheba tells him after her neardeath experience sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her fathers car she grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information only after sheba has ground the guys face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a payoff at the towns railroad museum brick accompanies sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered pilot getting away by the skin of his chinlater pilot sends a quintet of outoftown contract thugs armedtotheteeth to trash andys office these gunsels ignore their nokill orders not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons but they also blast shebas dad with a shotgun sheba retaliates in short order wielding her nickelplated revolver she guns down three of the four assailants dirty harry style the last hitman discards his weapon and pleads for mercy sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson charles kissinger of abby and a uniform cop arrive on the scene at the hospital andy shayne dies holding his daughters hand naturally pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy afterward sheba tracks down a loan shark walker christopher joy of cleopatra jones and pries information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming walker warns pilot about sheba pilot and his henchmen confront sheba in a parking lot and swap lead sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival while the police corner one of pilots men she deals with the others pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and sheba runs him down she pins pilot to a rollercoaster track and threatens to hold him there until the rollercoaster cuts his head off pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man shark dick merrifield of the hellcats whose reputation is so immaculate that detective jackson describes him as the guy with all the right answers sheba baby isnt topnotch pam grier however the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick",

die hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it isbut unlike passenger and under siege which are decent die hard clones on their own terms cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaksyears before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundingsthe opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening not even harlins shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea or the ridiculous expression on ralph waites face can dim the sequences powerthe next impressive setpiece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody doublecrosses are completely unexpected as roger ebert has observed the stuntman who made the midair transfer between the planes deserves some special recognitionlater during the avalanche sequence one of the terroriststhieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain so far as i know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot but the shot itself remains impressive because were left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the secondunit directors knew exactly where to place the cameraill take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week because hes one of the few movie stars ive ever seen whos completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain the role of gabe walker really complements stallones acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively lowkey performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himselfin contrast to many of todays postmatrix comic bookinspired action heroes stallones walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computerenhanced abilities in cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another he winces when hes hit and bleeds when hes cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rockystyle pummeling from one of the maddog villainsit should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movies effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point i actually cheered as one of the most coldblooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demiselithgows british accent is as unconvincing as the movies occasional model plane or model helicopter but hes fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages stallone and rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says you stay you fetch even a better actor such as anthony hopkins might have had trouble with that lineeven if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining showearly in the movie for example lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face and this precipitates a gripping tugofwar between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leglithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadnt given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captordone very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser filmbesides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already actionpacked narrative finally harlins decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenesits a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later but perhaps its best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker cliffhanger belongs on the imdbs top listrating very good especially considering most of stallones other movies",

lustig aaron oliver kolker but they dont believe him then shortly after the same thing happens again the phone call the man the prostitute her death reported in the papers martin decides he has to find the killer put a stop to his killing spree but who is itthis argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days why so long on a budget of about why so much was written directed by sergio esquenazi i cannot believe some of the glowing comments interferencia has on the imdb out of user ratings as i write this of them rate this pile of crap out of i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of out of if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it i honestly dont believe that if you showed interferencia to average people that well over of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect no way on earth the user comments are also amazingly positive all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film this the one user besides me who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom out of which sounds just about right everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up where do i start how on earth can i adequately describe how bad interferencia is the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by its terrible twists while most twists turn a plot on its head alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever relevant way are genuine surprises here in interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film makes it utterly pointless in a it didnt actually happen sort of way the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers what made martin go mad why did he imagine the phone calls why did he imagine a killer why did he imagine the newspaper headlines no explanation is given for martins behaviour during the first hour or so of the film theres just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind thats it thats all the exposition there is then theres a plot twist about martins missing wife her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason i am sorry but interferencia is so bad its so boring its so badly written thought out that i honestly cant think of a positive thing to say about it sorry guys but thats how i feel quite simply interferencia is one of the worst films i have ever seen is a complete mess both conceptually technicallyaccording to the imdb interferencia was hot in just eight days to be honest it doesnt feel like that at all nope it feels more like it was shot in five days the whole film is an eyesore interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting i have ever seen its like no attempt was made to light the scenes its like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft becomes increasingly irritating this strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring noticeable theres no real horror or scares in fact i would say interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge a knife is stuck in someones mouth nothing elseaccording to the imdb this had a budget of about which makes interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window we should accept any old crap wrong to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product if this can get released praised like its oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage including embarrassing karaoke footage scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap win top prizes at the next cannes film festival the acting is awful although the female lead virginia lustig is actually rather sexy helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bitinterferencia is an absolutely terrible film seriously i beg you dont be fooled by all the fake positive comments there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a or out of an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through sorry but thats the way i see it sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you have been warned",

mythical shangrila is a real special gem music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david a strange mixture of straight drama adventure and musical sequences it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states but made a lot of money overseas only in america did it fail highly different and unique in its approach as a film musical it deserves far better credit than its given as a story lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the frank capra film and this musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel what i like about the version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer this is a burt bacharach shangrila and its a wonderful place songs like the world is a circle share the joy and living together growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel why shouldnt shangrila be a slightly goofy place the two love songs i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture theres a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story moreover the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody its a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping singing and dancing on tables theyre a wonderful team and the number is well staged i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangrila the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole he has no hope for the world outside of shangrila if this film were to be remade today it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character richard onways conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what hes found in shangrilaof course for the film to be believable the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end like he was in the book neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard did conway find shangrila or was it imagined did they all die in the plane crash every man has his own idea of what his shangrila would be the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangrila and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley interesting how conway doesnt want to leave paradise but is being pressured out by his brother both versions of lost horizon work in different ways but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule so in a sense its anti capitalism in its theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation human kindness decency compassion courtesy etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding one has to remember that lost horizon in was post cabaret it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical much less to be dubbed by other singers lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics the expectations for it were high almost unreasonable there were two targets to be hit the producer ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television it was nominated for academy awards including best picture at the time burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider midnight cowboy and the godfather sex and violence was a new frontier in the late s and early s audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels its the ultimate escapist film with a strong story wonderful music an expensive budget and some quirky humor its unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until minutes into the film it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not lost horizon is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than its reputation",

films in hollywood only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or nonexistent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screenhollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the s among the supporting players is louella parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments ive seen she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script makeup specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble anotherthis film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important peopledick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodmans band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing hooray for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the makeup king rin tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of th century fox and the name donald duck was substituted in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodmans orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is rehearsingpowell leaves the band and his girl friend frances langford and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving saxophonists he is met by allen joslyn the publicist of the studio the owner is grant mitchell joslyn is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the studios temperamental star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean hagen in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan lockwood is one alexander dupre alan mowbray scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being bypassed for an outofthe ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film joslyn finds a double for her lolas real life sister rosemary lane and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the followup party but she attends with powell joslyn wanting someone who doesnt know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractivethe complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of hoodlums powells contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted healey actually not too bad in this film he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be dupres singing voice in a ripoff of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when rosemary lane herbert and healey help give powell his chance to show its his voice not mowbraysits quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to its time several jokes concerning africanamericans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood healey accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to joslyn to watch out powell photographs too darkly get the point also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either herberts hoohooing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december but most of the film is quite good and wont disappoint the viewer

since it was announced some half a year earlier we came back from florida days after the movie aired and i immediately watched it i tried as hard as i could to like it but i didnti am a huge stooges fan and as such i know quite a bit about them so it wasnt like i was expecting to learn anything from the movie and i didnt i was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was there were many things wrong with this film the actors the script the reenactments all could have been much betterpaul benvictor is a tremendously talented actor but lets face facts moe howard was way out of his reach he doesnt look like him he doesnt sound like him and thus he cant act like him michael chiklis is also very talented but his portrayal of curly didnt quite score with me although when curly becomes ill he did very well at that john kassirs portrayal of shemp couldve been rehearsed better it was more of a bad impression than a portrayal worst of all was joe besser they made him skinny and more annoying than he really was it was just plain laziness i dont like the joe shorts because as the movie illustrates he hardly ever got hit but he wasnt that annoying and definately wasnt that thin the best performance belongs to evan handler he had the most accurate stooge portrayal the problem with larrys character his hair is way too frizzy and way too red i know thats too technical so i wont count that on my list of why i didnt like this movieback to shemp who just so happens to be my favorite stooge he is written as a whining quivering chicken true he had many phobias but he wasnt that bad he didnt leave the group initially because he was afraid of ted healy although he didnt like him shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldnt turn down instead of the truth this movie chooses to make him wet the bed on larry no less run into a closet and shamefully bow out of the group another problem is that shemp made nearly as many columbia shorts as curly did as a stooge but only one fright night which was his first short is shown his career was almost completely ignored plus lousy editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error shemp was born in early and died in late that would make him how old at death well heres a hint its not as the movie statesnow for the writing which i think was flawed only because this movie was rushed out some of the lines are dumb and could be developed andor introduced much better than they were the one line that really got me was at the very end of the film when moe is showing the promoter how the eyepoke is donethats how we do it make contact with the brow bone not the eyes looks real on film though this line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film its meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh in amazement and im sure it did with some people but the very end of the movie was not the place for this line a better place you ask how about when they show up at columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine i know initially there was no sound for the eyepoke but moe for instance could have said what about this and eyepokes curly or larry jules white then says are you okay or howd you do that there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out another one involves the origin of the name shemp although that one isnt as bad and so i will let that one slidewhat does this film do well it illustrates how the stooges were screwed by columbia which they were im not sure if moe was an errand boy but that was the kind of dramatization stuff that is meant to get the viewer sympathizing with them i know this film was a dramatization i know not everything is going to be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect however some of the stuff they made up and the real stuff that they ignored were in serious conflict with each other for instance curlys stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life i know i know dramatization but the purpose of dramatizations is to make real events more dramatic curlys stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie heres what really happened curly was sitting in a chair off screen while a scene was being shot they called him for the final pie fight scene but there was no response moe went to go get him and discovered his little brother head slumped half paralyzed unable to speak and tears streaming down his face moe then said babe and tried to help him out of his chair poor curly drops to his knees then the ambulance was calledall in all this movie wasnt terrible but it certainly wasnt good or even ok this film portrays the stooges helplessly and inaccurately and sometimes goes overboard with dramatizations there is a very very long list of inaccuracies in this film if you dont believe me check out a fella named stooges list at the threestoogescom news forum it is about a page and a half long some things in the movie i can let slide but others were unforgivable the three stooges were geniuses and a lot of todays comedy is based off of what they did dont believe me check out the simpsons and more so ren stimpy but this film fails to capture their genius it more so inaccurately captures their hardships which is important but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges it has to portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything",
